# Day 3 of 30:

Today's focus was on adding images, integrating Google Fonts, and using the ElevatedButton widget in Flutter. I enhanced the login page design by incorporating these elements, which greatly improved its visual appeal and functionality. Every day, I am gaining a deeper understanding of Flutter and becoming more adept at building polished, cross-platform applications.

Stay tuned for more updates on my journey! ðŸš€ðŸ“±
